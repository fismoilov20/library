## Getting Started
First you will need to clone the repository:
  1) Create a new directory on your local machine or favourite code editor (VS Code, Atom etc...). I have called mine library. This is your "root directory".
  2) Go into the root directory and open a terminal right-clicking and holding Shift (if you're in Windows Explorer) or Ctrl + \`, then cd into the root directory (if you're in VS Code).
  3) You can now clone, using the command 'git clone' or using GitHub CLI (or alternatives as Git Bash):
  ```
  # option 1 - HTTPS
  git clone https://github.com/fismoilov20/library.git
  
  # option 2 - Github CLI
  gh repo clone fismoilov20/library
  ```
***

You should now have all files copied to your root directory (inside /library/ in mine). 
  1) Virtual Environment â€“ in the terminal (if you have already installed python virtual environment, if not run "pip install virtualenv" first) run the following commands to create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
Now activate the virtual environment with the following command:
```
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# mac/linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
